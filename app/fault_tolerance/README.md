# Fault-tolerance mechanisms — where each one lives

Every mechanism is switched by `FT_ENABLED` (software) or `RESTART_POLICY`
(self-healing). With both off you get the **baseline**: same code, same replicas,
nothing that uses them.

## Software (`software/`)


| #   | Mechanism                            | File                                                                 | One line                                                                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| S1  | Retry + exponential backoff + jitter | `[software/retry.py](software/retry.py)`                             | a failed call is repeated on the next replica, waiting 50·2ⁿ ms × random |
| S2  | Timeouts                             | `[software/timeouts.py](software/timeouts.py)`                       | every wait in the system is bounded; all deadlines in one file           |
| S3  | Circuit breaker                      | `[software/circuit_breaker.py](software/circuit_breaker.py)`         | 5 failures in a row → stop calling that service for 5 s                  |
| S4  | Health checks                        | `[software/health_check.py](software/health_check.py)`               | gateway polls `/health` every 1 s, dead replicas leave rotation          |
| S5  | Idempotency + duplicate detection    | `[software/idempotency.py](software/idempotency.py)`                 | same Idempotency-Key twice → original result, no second charge           |
| S6  | Checkpoint + rollback / recovery     | `[software/checkpoint_rollback.py](software/checkpoint_rollback.py)` | `pending` row before the charge; a sweep rolls back what a crash left    |
| S7  | Graceful degradation                 | `[software/degradation.py](software/degradation.py)`                 | everything failed on a read → recent stale data, HTTP 203 `degraded`     |
| S8  | Fail-fast writes                     | `[software/timeouts.py](software/timeouts.py)` `DB_ACQUIRE_S`        | no primary database → write fails in ms instead of hanging               |
| S9  | Service replication                  | see H1                                                               |                                                                          |
| S10 | Job checkpoint + lease adoption      | `[software/job_checkpoint.py](software/job_checkpoint.py)`           | timetable job saves progress; another replica resumes it after a crash   |
