# Fault-Tolerant University Information System

A small distributed university platform (students, payments, transcripts,
timetables), built **twice**: a **baseline** and a **fault-tolerant** version. Both
versions get the same faults injected, and the measured difference shows what the
fault-tolerance mechanisms buy.

Both versions are **one and the same code and image**. The only difference is the
switch `FT_ENABLED=0|1` (plus `RESTART_POLICY`), so every measured difference is
caused by the mechanisms and nothing else.

Stack: Python + FastAPI, PostgreSQL 16 with streaming replication, Docker Compose,
Prometheus. The experiment harness is TypeScript on Node 22.

## Running

Same commands on Windows, macOS and Linux. Needs Docker and Node.js 22.6 or newer
(`node --version`; with nvm: `nvm use 22`). No other dependencies.

    npm run up:ft           # deploy the fault-tolerant version  (FT_ENABLED=1)
    npm run up:baseline     # deploy the baseline                (FT_ENABLED=0)
    npm run mode            # which version is running now

    npm run demo            # live demo: app crash, DB failure, node failure, timetable
    npm run demo -- db-failure   # just one scenario
    npm run exp app-crash   # one controlled experiment
    npm run campaign        # all six against the deployed version

    npm run monitoring      # Prometheus on http://localhost:9090
    # Swagger UI:           http://localhost:8080/docs  (every service: :30xx/docs)

After pulling schema changes, recreate the database once: `docker compose down -v`.

## Services and ports

| Component | Port | Instances |
|---|---|---|
| gateway | 8080 | 1 |
| student-1 / student-2 | 3011 / 3012 | 2 replicas |
| payment-1 / payment-2 | 3021 / 3022 | 2 replicas |
| timetable-1 / timetable-2 | 3041 / 3042 | 2 replicas |
| transcript-1 | 3031 | 1 |
| postgres-primary / postgres-replica | 55432 / 55433 | primary + hot standby |
| prometheus | 9090 | optional (`--profile monitoring`) |

## Breaking it by hand

    curl -X POST localhost:3011/chaos/crash                              # application crash
    J='content-type: application/json'                                   # /chaos needs a JSON body
    curl -X POST localhost:3011/chaos -H "$J" -d '{"latencyMs":3000}'            # slow service
    curl -X POST localhost:3021/chaos -H "$J" -d '{"crashAfterCheckpoint":true}' # interrupted payment
    docker compose stop postgres-primary                                 # database failure
    docker compose kill student-1 payment-1                              # node failure

`docker compose kill` is an operator stop and deliberately does **not** trip the
restart policy, which makes it a faithful "the node is gone" simulation. An
application crash must therefore come from inside the process (`/chaos/crash`).

## Measurement

Every service appends one JSON line per event to `logs/events.jsonl`:

    {"ts":…,"svc":"gateway","ft":1,"kind":"health","target":"http://student-1:3000","ok":false}
    {"ts":…,"svc":"gateway","ft":1,"kind":"route","instance":"http://student-2:3000","attempts":2}
    {"ts":…,"svc":"payment-1","ft":1,"kind":"recovery","action":"duplicate_suppressed"}

Every metric in `reports/` is computed from this log plus the per-request workload
log; no number is asserted without raw data behind it. The same events are counted
live on `GET /metrics` of every service for Prometheus.
